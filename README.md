# revbranch - add branch names to git revisions to help understand repository history

## Installation

```
pip install revbranch
```

## Notes

I'm trying to use `poetry`.

I like to have the virtualenv inside the directory, and this makes it work:

```
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```
